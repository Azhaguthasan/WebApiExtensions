# WebApiExtensions
ApiDescription Extensions to convert to a simplified structure that can be exposed for client consumption

When target Web Api services from a typescript project, one often needs to create types/model object structure in the client. In order to automate the process, this extension helps in simplifying the ApiDescription object so that it can be exposed for any automation tool that can create types. 

This library is available in Nuget.

This is used in conjunction with "ts-webapi-ref" npm module.
